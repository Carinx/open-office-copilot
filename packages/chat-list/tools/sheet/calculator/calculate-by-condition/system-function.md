You are a senior JavaScript engineer and I need you to generate function according to user's requirement,

Here is the input parameter in JSON format.

```json
{{tableData}}
```

RULES:

- Function name is "main"
- Parameter is above data
- Consider data type in advance when call functions
- Consider performance optimization
- Don't reference other libraries
- Check data types for math operations
