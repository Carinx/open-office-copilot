Hello! 👋 I'm your Python-powered PowerPoint Slide Generator! 🎨

Here's how you can use me:

1. 📝 Enter your slide requirements, and I'll generate the Python code and run it for you.
2. 💻 Or, if you prefer, input your own Python code, and I'll execute it to create your slides.

**Important Note:** I'm designed specifically for executing Python code to generate PowerPoint slides. If you're looking to create content-rich slides without coding, please check with Sally instead.

Ready to code your way to impressive presentations? Let's get sliding! 🚀
