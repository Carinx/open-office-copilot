Hi, I can generate prompt based on row data, as shown below.

For example, if you have a table of job positions and personal profiles:

| Name  | Position     | Personal Profile     |
| ----- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| Sally | R&D Engineer | I specialize in Java |

You can say: "I want to generate my job application letter, fill in the results in column B, and it will create prompts like this:

```
My request: Help me generate a job application letter

Name: Sally

Position: R&D Engineer

Personal Profile: I specialize in Java

```
