SHEET NAME:{{sheetName}}

DATA RANGE:{{address}}

USER INPUT:{{input}}

You need to help me analyze the data range of data with headers,There may be multiple row headers, and you need to identify the true header of the table next to data rows.

This image shows the first five rows of data in the excel,The end position of the data range needs to refer to DATA RANGE:{{address}}

I need enough information to generate Python, so you need to output information based on USER INPUT, including

- true table headers and header address
- data range with true headers next to data rows
- Python program design ideas

Other Information:

- file path is `/input/data.xlsx`
- output file to folder `/output`
- the function generated need a main function

Respond in the same language as the USER INPUT, Ask user if they want to continue to run Python.
