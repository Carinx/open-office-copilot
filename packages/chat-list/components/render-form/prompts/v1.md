I need you to help me populate the data from a form into a 2D table with the following example of JSON data:

[JSON SAMPLATE DATA]

```json
{{samplate_data}}
```

[FORM DATA]

```
{{form_data}}
```

Replace the places where there is a value with a placeholder for the target value, please refer to the example data to help fill in the above 2-dimensional JSON array and return to me the final result

RULES:

- Do not fill in the information at the position of the empty string
- Do not modify the empty string.
- Change the original value of the example to a placeholder for the target value, replacing the template value in its entirety and not splitting the target value.
